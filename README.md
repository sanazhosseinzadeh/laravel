# laravel
Laravel is a web application framework with an expressive, elegant syntax. Its belief is that development should be both enjoyable and creative. Laravel attempts to make development fun by easing common tasks used in most web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, templating, caching, and more.

Laravel attempts to combine the very best of what they have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Where did the name Laravel come from?
The name Laravel is a made up word, but according to Taylor Otwell, the creator of the framework, the inspiration came from the Narnia books

In Narnia, Cair Paravel is the name of the castle where the kings and queens of Narnia live. Laravel rhymes with Paravel.

When was the first release of Laravel?
Laravel's first beta release was made available on June 9, 2011, but the v1 wasn't out very long and Laravel v2 was released just a few months later in September of 2011.

Who designed the Laravel website and logo?
The current design of both the site and the logo was designed by Focuslab and it launched on August 2019. You can read more about this in our announcement post.

Laravel focuses on the end-user first: which means it focus is on simplicity, clarity, and getting work done. People and companies are using it to build everything from simple hobby projects all the way to Fortune 500 companies.


This look at Laravel will not be exhaustive, but if you want a more exhaustive introduction I recommend the book Laravel: Up and Running. This tutorial does expect a few prerequisites and here is what you will need to follow along:

A local PHP environment (Valet, Homestead, Vagrant, MAMP, etc.).
A database (I’ll be using MySQL)
PHPUnit installed.
Node JS installed.
Note: For the local PHP development I Recommend Mac OSX and Valet because it automatically sets everything up. If you are on Windows, consider Homestead or some flavor of a virtual machine. Another option is a community-provided Windows port of Valet.


Planning
Every project has to start somewhere; either a project assignment at work or just an idea in your head. No matter where it originates, thoroughly planning out all the features before you start coding is paramount in completing a project.

How you plan is dependent on how your mind works. As a visual person, I like to plan on paper, drawing out the way I picture the screens looking and then working backward into how I would code it. Others prefer to write a project plan in a text file, wiki, or some mind mapping tool. It doesn’t matter how you plan, just that you do it.

For this guide, we are going to be building a link directory. Here is a list of fundamental goals for this links app:

Display a simple list of links.
Create a form where people can submit new links.
Validate the form.
Insert the data into the database.
