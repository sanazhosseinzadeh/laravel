# laravel

Since its initial release in 2011, Laravel has experienced exponential growth. In 2015, it became the most starred PHP framework on GitHub and rose to the go-to framework for people all over the world. If you'd like to learn more about the history, check out what is Laravel.

Laravel focuses on the end-user first: which means it focus is on simplicity, clarity, and getting work done. People and companies are using it to build everything from simple hobby projects all the way to Fortune 500 companies.


This look at Laravel will not be exhaustive, but if you want a more exhaustive introduction I recommend the book Laravel: Up and Running. This tutorial does expect a few prerequisites and here is what you will need to follow along:

A local PHP environment (Valet, Homestead, Vagrant, MAMP, etc.).
A database (I’ll be using MySQL)
PHPUnit installed.
Node JS installed.
Note: For the local PHP development I Recommend Mac OSX and Valet because it automatically sets everything up. If you are on Windows, consider Homestead or some flavor of a virtual machine. Another option is a community-provided Windows port of Valet.


Planning
Every project has to start somewhere; either a project assignment at work or just an idea in your head. No matter where it originates, thoroughly planning out all the features before you start coding is paramount in completing a project.

How you plan is dependent on how your mind works. As a visual person, I like to plan on paper, drawing out the way I picture the screens looking and then working backward into how I would code it. Others prefer to write a project plan in a text file, wiki, or some mind mapping tool. It doesn’t matter how you plan, just that you do it.

For this guide, we are going to be building a link directory. Here is a list of fundamental goals for this links app:

Display a simple list of links.
Create a form where people can submit new links.
Validate the form.
Insert the data into the database.
